# Insider Threat Tweet Generator

This project is a Python-based application that generates tweets simulating different types of insider threats using a fine-tuned pretrained AI model. The program can generate tweets in multiple categories, including **Medical**, **Malicious**, and **Normal** tweets, to facilitate realistic insider threat simulations. It leverages a fine-tuned Transformer model to produce varied and contextually accurate outputs for each threat type.

## Features

- **Multi-Category Tweet Generation**: Generate tweets for various insider threat types:
  - **Medical**: Tweets related to insider threats in the medical sector, simulating potential data leaks or misuse of sensitive medical information.
  - **Malicious**: Tweets representing malicious insider behavior, such as sabotage, espionage, or unauthorized access.
  - **Normal**: General, non-threatening tweets that mimic regular insider communications.
- **Pretrained Model Fine-Tuning**: Utilizes a fine-tuned pretrained AI model to produce realistic and contextually accurate tweet outputs.
- **Customization Options**: Adjust the tone and style of tweets to appear more overt or subtle based on the selected threat type.
